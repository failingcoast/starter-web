There are very few intelligent, attractive and straight men in this town. Well, that certainly leaves me out. You're losing blood, aren't you? Probably, my socks are wet. My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer. This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence.
